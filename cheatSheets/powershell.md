About PowerShell

**PowerShell** is a powerful command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. It is designed to help users automate tasks, manage systems, and perform administrative tasks efficiently. Built on the .NET framework, **PowerShell** is both a ***command-line tool*** and ***a scripting environment***, making it a versatile tool for programmers and system administrators.

>"PowerShell is great because we had a series of rockstar engineers add their awesomeness to the project."

foreach ($file in $files) {
Write-Output "$($file.Name) - $($file.Length) bytes"
}
